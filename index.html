    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img id="image" src="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/27550620?v=3&u=153d32ff31be240f0c5ea6d178d42c763b10bf6f&s=400">
    <p>My name is Justen Jones and I am a twenty-two year old living in Phoenix, Arizona.
    I am originally from Oregon and have moved around a lot as a kid learning and experiencing new things. I enjoy the outdoors and have found a deep passion for photography.</p>
    <h1> My Background</h1>
    <p>I attended Northern Arizona University where I was pursuing a degree in Business Management with a minor in Photo Journalism. Unfortunately my brain was attacked by a virus which led to me leaving school and returning to the valley for
    some much needed rest and relaxation. I am currently attending Coder Camps in hopes that it will lead to a long and rewarding career in this industry.</p>
    <h1>Why Programming?</h1>
    <p>I have always loved puzzles and problem solving as a kid. I didnt know much about programming prior to signing up for Coder Camps, however, the more research I have done the more I have fallen in love with programming.
    Forcing mysefl to think outside the box, and creating something that will help someone or simply let someone enjoy what they are doing sounds very rewarding. I see myself doing this for many years to come.</p>
